# 42 CommonCore

This is a summary about my year as 42Barcelona student.

I started with the fundamentals of C programming and memory management, then moved on to file handling, sysadmin basics and some network knoledge.

As I advanced, I faced challenges in algorithm optimization, process communication, graphical programming, and multithreading, eventually building my own Unix shell. 

This hands-on path not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of both low-level and high-level computing concepts.

This is a list of my projects that i've worked in this wonderful year:
